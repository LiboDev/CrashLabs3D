# Store / portal asset requirements

Last checked: 2026-09-26. Portal rules change; re-verify before submission (links below).

## What was found

### YouTube Playables Developer Portal
- The public page describes the portal as a **private preview** (invite only). It does **not** publish image dimension rules; the upload form inside the portal is authoritative. Check it when you have access.

### Google GameSnacks marketing config (closest published spec from the same Google games family)
Source: https://developers.google.com/gamesnacks/developer/config/marketing (paraphrased)

| Field | Aspect | Required size | Optional sizes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Horizontal banner | 16:9 | 1920x1080 | 480x270, 240x135 | |
| Vertical banner | 9:16 | 1080x1920 | 270x480, 135x240 | |
| Screenshots | 16:9 or 9:16 | >= 1920x1080 / 1080x1920 | | at least 3 different screenshots |
| Game icon | 1:1 | 512x512 | 256x256, 128x128 | **no transparency, no shadows** |
| Trailer (video) | 16:9 | one at 1920x1080 | | optional field |

This kit targets these as the baseline because they are the strictest published numbers.

### YouTube Playables certification (affects what the art may show)
- Design requirements: the game must work at any aspect ratio (examples 9:32 ... 32:9), so capture both orientations and extremes.
  https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/certification/requirements_design
- Content must suit a general 13+ audience; no personal data, no off-platform links. Keep promo art family-friendly, no people/gore, no URLs or social handles.
  https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/certification/requirements
- Do not imitate YouTube UI or use YouTube logos in your art (branding guidelines).
  https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines
- Rights: you must own/clear every asset. Check the terms of the image model you use for commercial rights; keep the prompt log (`_jobs/*.log`) as provenance.
